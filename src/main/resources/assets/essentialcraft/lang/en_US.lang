essentialcraft.page.wind_0.txt=Magical wind. What is it? We all know it, we all had met it at some point in our lives, but what it actually is? Well, the answer is pretty simple!|The wind is somewhat of a living creature, that likes to observe people with unique fate!
essentialcraft.page.wind_1.txt=This effect you can get randomly just by doing random stuff in the world. It does nothing on it's own. It will only happen if you are bound to the wind!
essentialcraft.page.wind_2.txt=Wind mages can randomly spawn in your world.
essentialcraft.page.wind_3.txt=Wind mages occasionally drop these items. You can right-click them to release the trapped wind, and, therefore, increase your relations with it. Read the Enderstar section to learn how to bind yourself to the wind.
essentialcraft.page.wind_4.txt=Wind archmages rarely drop one of the armour pieces. Each piece of the armorset will increase the amount of wind relation points you gain from any source by 23%
essentialcraft.page.wind_5.txt=You can drink the Air Potion to increase the chance of random wind-related world events. The potions stack with themselves!
essentialcraft.page.drops_0.txt=You can use specific items on specific structures to harness the power of elements of nature into gems! Just create an appropriate structure and throw the required item in the middle. You can throw stacks, it does not matter. There is a 60% chance for elements to condense.
essentialcraft.page.drops_1.txt=To craft Fire Drops use Blaze powder.
essentialcraft.page.drops_2.txt=To craft Water Drops use Clay.
essentialcraft.page.drops_3.txt=To craft Earth Drops use Slime.
essentialcraft.page.drops_4.txt=To craft Air Drops use Gunpowder.
essentialcraft.page.drops_5.txt=You can craft elemental drops. They are used in lots of crafts. You can also craft different tools, but that will come later.
essentialcraft.page.miscCrafts_0.txt=All items and devices you want to craft are really complicated, and can't be crafted from simplest resources. This means, that you have to use some advanced items to make the devices. And here they are!
essentialcraft.page.mru_0.txt=Now we are getting close to the bases. What is MRU? Is this some kind of energy? In fact, here lies the answer to this question. It may be kinda complicated, so I warn you!
essentialcraft.page.mru_1.txt=First of all, as we all know everything consists of so called 'molecules'. And those molecules are created from bunch of even smaller particles - atoms. The atoms are not the smallest objects - they are made from some electrons, neutrons and protons.
essentialcraft.page.mru_2.txt=The atom represents a tiny solar system - it has a core, created from neutrons and protons, and electrons rotate around it in some form of layers. And this is not even it's 'final form'! It can be divided into even smaller objects, but we do not need to do so right now.
essentialcraft.page.mru_3.txt=Here is a hand-drawn imaginary model of an atom of a matter called 'Lithium'.
essentialcraft.page.mru_4.txt=The thing at the center represents the core, and the teal things are electrons. See anything unusual here? You should. There seems to be another particle, smaller than electrons, purplish color. What is it?
essentialcraft.page.mru_5.txt=And you have guessed correctly! Those particles are indeed MRU particles! MRU stands for Magical Radiation Unit. Let's try to get the meaning of those words. There is nothing to say about the fact, that it is a unit, but what about other words?
essentialcraft.page.mru_6.txt=Why is it Radiation? Because it behaves like γ particles! It radiates everything, sometimes doing bad things, but in general it does nothing for non-living stuff, and living creatures have a protection against it!
essentialcraft.page.mru_7.txt=Why is it magic then? Because it can, if it's central point of rotation changes transform one element into another! This particles seem to group with each other - at least, on the rotation speed and relative rotation point.
essentialcraft.page.mru_8.txt=This effect is called MRU Field. Basically, if there are come particles with odd rotation speed they can set the rotation speed of particles around them to their speed! This, as you can guess can lead to disasters!
essentialcraft.page.mru_9.txt=Thankfully, the MRU found in world is, pretty much, 100% balanced. It means, that it cannot harm anything, and will not change the matter around itself.
essentialcraft.page.mru_10.txt=As you can guess, the rotation speed is so called 'balance' of the MRU. If the particle rotates too slow or too fast it changes the central point of it's rotation, and can start harming everything around it.
essentialcraft.page.mru_11.txt=Sometimes, if too much unstable MRU leak into the world, the so called MRU Field becomes a little bit more global. They start creating so called 'MRUCU' - Magical Radiation Unit Concentration Unit. Lots of units there, huh?
essentialcraft.page.mru_12.txt=Here is a picture of a 100% balanced MRUCU. Yes, they exist too!
essentialcraft.page.mru_13.txt=Usually MRUCUs will get their balance shifted to one or other side. There is another problem - you simply cannot SEE the MRUCUs! There are items, that allow you to see them, but you can't make them now. 
essentialcraft.page.mru_14.txt=However, you can HEAR MRUCUs! They make a little noise, that you can hear, if you listen carefully. If MRUCU is pretty big it will start corrupting the world around itself.|It is also known, that standing near MRUCUs without any protection may lead to some nasty effects...
essentialcraft.page.mru_15.txt=You can simply break those corruption blocks, just do not stand in them for too long! You can also MOVE MRUCUs using MRUCU Moving Wands. They break after some time too. To pull MRUCUs hold rightclick, and to push them also hold SHIFT.
essentialcraft.page.soulStone_0.txt=Every living thing has 'MRU Matrix'. This matrix cannot be seen or otherwise known of, and it serves as a protection from various MRU effects. However, there is a way to see the numeric representation of your matrix - the Soul Stone!
essentialcraft.page.soulStone_1.txt=To make a Soul Stone throw some emeralds on an emerald block surrounded by soul sand.
essentialcraft.page.soulStone_2.txt=To make the soul stone read information bound it to yourself by right-clicking.
essentialcraft.page.soulStone_3.txt=Now, the lines represent your matrix. The second line represents the amount of MRU stored in your matrix. The last line represents the balance of your matrix, and the first one represents the player the stone is bound to. You will need this stone later on, so keep it!
essentialcraft.page.soulStone_4.txt=You can increase the amount of MRU in your matrix by killing living creatures. Every time a creature dies you get a chance to absorb some of it's matrix energy. The more max health the mob had, the more MRU you will get as a result.
essentialcraft.page.soulStone_5.txt=It is worth mentioning, that if you die you lose ALL MRU energy in your matrix, and have to start all over again. On the other hand, if a player kills another player ALL MRU energy from the victim will go to the killer.
essentialcraft.page.soulStone_6.txt=If you have Blood Magic installed, you can imbue the Soul Stone with blood using altar(tier 1 is enough), and the result will be the same soul stone, that is able to tell your Life Network!
essentialcraft.page.book_0.txt=Welcome to EssentialCraft, and to the amazing and long-waited Book Of Knowledge! Here I will tell you almost all you need to know to play with EssentialCraft!
essentialcraft.page.book_1.txt=And the most important thing is of course the book! 
essentialcraft.page.book_2.txt=The book is pretty easy to navigate. It is divided by categories. The book itself has a tier based system, so you will need to update it using specific crafts and rituals. Every new tier unlocks you a new category.
essentialcraft.page.book_3.txt=Every category has a name and a short description. Basically, if you need to lookup something basic, that you can get without playing with EssentialCraft - look in the Basic section. If you need to look up a machine - Magical Engineering is there!
essentialcraft.page.book_4.txt=Each category contains some 'discoveries' - sections of specific information. They also have both the name and a short description. If you mouse over any category, you can see, how many discoveries are in there.
essentialcraft.page.book_5.txt=Every discovery contains a certain amount of pages with different information on them. It can be straight up plain text, as here. It can be a crafting recipe of any kind, including structures! It can also be an image, or just a set of items.
essentialcraft.page.book_6.txt=Items on pages can sometimes be left-clicked, if there is a recipe for such item. However, if you can not craft the item, but the displayed item has a Goto in it's description it will most likely browse you to the page, where that item is displayed.
essentialcraft.page.book_7.txt=If you want to go back (for example you've read enough of this and want to lookup some information about MRU) there is an orange pointer in the top right corner of the book. The book is also fully controllable by the keyboard - try it out by pressing your arrow keys, backspace and things like ctrl. You can even input the number of the discovery/category to go to with your number keys and press enter!
essentialcraft.page.book_8.txt=You can close the book any time you want, do something, and when you open it it will stay at the same page you were on. Unless you close your game.
essentialcraft.page.book_9.txt=When browsing a recipe you may want to lookup a recipe for an item, that is used in the craft you are interested in. If that item has a recipe, you can left-click it, and you will be shown the exact recipe you are looking for.
essentialcraft.page.book_10.txt=If you want to go back to the first thing you want to craft (the page you've left by left-clicking) you can right-click the screen in any place to go back. The way you go through the book is stored infinitely.
essentialcraft.page.book_11.txt=On the title page there is a line, that says Edition. The numbers below are your version of EssentialCraft.
essentialcraft.page.book_12.txt=If you want to lookup a quick recipe/information about a block in the world just point at the block and press R on your keyboard.
essentialcraft.page.book_13.txt=The same rule applies to items - if an item lays on the ground you can look it up using the book.
essentialcraft.page.book_14.txt=You can lookup recipes/info about blocks and items even if you do not have the required tier of a book.
essentialcraft.page.book_15.txt=This is how you upgrade your book to tier 2. Thanks and have fun!
essentialcraft.page.decorations_0.txt=You can create lots of decorative blocks using the Magical Chisel! There are some variations, and you can create your own, using the config file! It is also possible to use those blocks in the corresponding structures, just like before chiseling.
essentialcraft.page.overworld_0.txt=The world has changed - it is not the same as it used to be. You can find some structures, that appear to be a part of some other MRU scientists from the past... Seems like deep, deep past, a very long time ago. They usually have a MRUCU in their center. They may also have some chests with fancy loot in them!
essentialcraft.page.overworld_1.txt=In different chests around your world you may find some interesting items - rings, amulets and belts. They can't be replicated - the technology seems lost, but you can use what is left. They all have a description, that tells you exactly what they do.

essentialcraft.page.boundGem_0.txt=Machines in EssentialCraft can generate or transfer MRU energy. We are talking about transferring right now. Every machine that can accept MRU will have a special slot with a gray gem icon in it. This slot is for the bound gem.
essentialcraft.page.boundGem_1.txt=There are no wires or pipes in essentialcraft. There are no tubes and/or golems. No robots. Any device can accept MRU energy on it's own. Basically, the Bound Gem serves as a location storage for the machine.
essentialcraft.page.boundGem_2.txt=When you right-click any device with a bound gem it will remember it's position and dimension. If you shift-rightclick the gem in your hand it will loose all that information. If the bound gem already stores the position, it will not relink to another device!
essentialcraft.page.boundGem_3.txt=If you do not see the specific slot in the device, try shift-clicking the gem in the GUI, it should automatically find a correct slot. Devices with bound gems can't get energy from any MRU storage, that is greater than 16 blocks away.
essentialcraft.page.boundGem_4.txt=Of course devices can't accept energy from other dimensions. However, they can accept MRU pretty much from ANY MRU storage, including other devices! Holding a bound gem in your hand will highlight the device it is liked to.
essentialcraft.page.matrixDestructor_0.txt=You will need a lot of MRU energy to work with your machines. Even the first one already require energy! To create your first bits of energy you will need this device.
essentialcraft.page.matrixDestructor_1.txt=Remember earlier we were talking about MRU Matrix of yours? Well, we are going to use MRU energy from there to create our first MRU! However, you only get 10% of your matrix's energy converted to MRU.
essentialcraft.page.matrixDestructor_2.txt=So, basically if you want to generate 5000MRU energy you will need to have 50000MRU in your matrix. The process is risk-free, however.
essentialcraft.page.matrixDestructor_3.txt=To use this device just put a Soul Stone into the only slot. It will start consuming the matrix of the person the stone is bound to - so NEVER give your soul stone to ANYONE!
essentialcraft.page.radiatingChamber_0.txt=Sometimes you need to radiate 2 items with MRU to get something different. Something interesting. Something, that you can use in crafts. And this device serves this exact purpose!
essentialcraft.page.radiatingChamber_1.txt=This device is able to radiate both blocks you put in the top and in the bottom slots with MRU you supply it with. However, there is one thing to note - it take the BALANCE of the MRU in count.
essentialcraft.page.radiatingChamber_2.txt=Every recipe in this thing has an upper balance threshold(▲) and the lower balance threshold(▼). If the supplied balance is above or below the craft will not work.
essentialcraft.page.radiatingChamber_3.txt=The Balance in the device will be the same, as in the block, that acts as an MRU source for this device.
essentialcraft.page.radiatingChamber_4.txt=It is worth saying, that while this device works it generates some unstable MRU in the world - it means, that it will create and empower MRUCU around itself. It will also put a nasty potion effect on you.
essentialcraft.page.miscRadiation_0.txt=You will certainly need some items to use in crafts - and, well, here they are:
essentialcraft.page.magicianTable_0.txt=Usually most of items in essentialcraft come from combining 5 different items and some MRU. Or just radiating 1 item with MRU. This is like an infusion in Thaumcraft - but you inject not the aspects, but MRU into the item.
essentialcraft.page.magicianTable_1.txt=Magician Table can do the exact requested thing! It is, basically, another crafting table of the mod. It needs a supply of MRU and some items. It does not care about the balance you give to it.
essentialcraft.page.magicianTable_2.txt=It is worth saying, that while this device works it generates some unstable MRU in the world - it means, that it will create and empower MRUCU around itself. It will also put a nasty potion effect on you.
essentialcraft.page.magicianTable_4.txt=The device can be upgraded using items, listed above. Each upgrade will increase the speed of the device, but will also increase the MRU usage. The more expensive the upgrade is, the more effect it will have on the device.
essentialcraft.page.magicianCrafts_0.txt=As said previously lots of items are made using the Magician Table. And here they are - full list! Just please, do not get too scared
essentialcraft.page.paleItems_0.txt=If you manage to apply MRU to certain items you can make them 'pale'. They will be able to mimic certain items and blocks in certain conditions. However, this process requires LOTS of MRU.
essentialcraft.page.magicMonocle_0.txt=You need a way to see MRUCUs and MRU rays. Here it is - this item, while held in your hand will show you all MRUCUs and MRU rays!
essentialcraft.page.mrucumover2_0.txt=You can make an upgrade for your MRUCU Moving Wand Tier I. This wand is better at all - it lasts longer, it has a bigger range and it functions just as Magical Monocle too!
essentialcraft.page.mrucuec_0.txt=To continue onwards you desire 2 things - you need a way to control those growing MRUCUs, so they do not destroy your house, and you need a way to get yourself some kind of MRU storage. Your problems - solved.
essentialcraft.page.mrucuec_3.txt=This is a structure, that cannot be drawn in the book, since it has no actual shape. It can be any shape as long as it has a rectangular form. It can be any size - but at least 5x5x5. At most it is 128x128x128.
essentialcraft.page.mrucuec_4.txt=You can build a structure from ANY blocks presented ABOVE this text. More expensive blocks yield more resistance to MRUCU corruption. The structure needs to have a closed outlines:
essentialcraft.page.mrucuec_6.txt=Now you just need to place a controller anywhere. The structure will initialize! However, you need to do one more thing - you need the structure to have an MRUCU anywhere INSIDE it.
essentialcraft.page.mrucuec.state_0.txt=To actually see the information about the structure you will need to place the MRUCUEC State Checker anywhere in a structure and wait for a little bit.
essentialcraft.page.mrucuec.state_2.txt=The Balance is the same as in the MRUCU inside the structure, and MROV... Lets say so - the more - the better!
essentialcraft.page.mrucuec.in_0.txt=You need a way to make MRU go inside your structure. Here it is - this block has a slot for a Bound Gem, and it is not afraid to collect all MRU it can!
essentialcraft.page.mrucuec.out_0.txt=You need a way to output MRU from the structure. Here it is - this block is recognized as an MRU storage by other devices. Funny enough you can actually connect this with MRUCUEC MRU Acceptors!
essentialcraft.page.mrucuec.storage_0.txt=You can increase the amount of MRU the structure can store by adding this block anywhere in the structure. Each block increases the storage by 100 000 MRU!
essentialcraft.page.naturalFurnace_0.txt=Everything living has an MRU matrix. Including grass, saplings and, most importantly, flowers.You are able to create a device, that will burn grass, saplings and flowers around it in 8 block radius on the same Y.
essentialcraft.page.naturalFurnace_1.txt=This device only generates 10 MRU/tick, and it generates different amounts of energy from different plants.
essentialcraft.page.heatGenerator_0.txt=You can generate MRU from items, burning under extreme temperature, and the more temperature - the more MRU!
essentialcraft.page.corruptionCleaner_0.txt=Tired of breaking those corruption blocks inside the MRUCUEC? Here is the solution! This device will slowly remove all corruption blocks in a radius of 8 blocks with a cost of 20MRU/tick!
essentialcraft.page.book_t2_0.txt=You now know all about the MRU and Matrix, time to see, how can you implement this into some industry?
essentialcraft.page.rayTower_0.txt=If you need to transfer MRU energy farther than 16 blocks you can use this. They have a slot for a bound gem, and they are pretty cheap.
essentialcraft.page.mrucuec.balancer_0.txt=This device is able to decrease the amount of corruption produced by MRUCUs. It is not powerful enough to completely stop the creation of corruption, but it will decrease the chance of MRUCU to create it by 95%! These do not stack with each other.
essentialcraft.page.mrucuec.redstone_0.txt=This device is able to output the redstone signal based on the percentage of MRU you have in the structure. You can change the settings by shift-clicking the device with an empty hand.
essentialcraft.page.magicalMirrors_0.txt=Using that Magic Purified Glass and Magical Plates you can create Magical Mirrors. They can be used to teleport items between inventories. You need to place a mirror above any inventory, and it will extract items from that inventory. Mirrors do not need MRU to work.
essentialcraft.page.magicalMirrors_1.txt=However, before using those mirrors you need to tell them, where to send items. You will need a Control Rod. Right-click a mirror you want to link, and then the inventory you want the linked mirror to transfer items to. The inventory must be located within 8 block from the mirror.

essentialcraft.page.crystals_0.txt=Lots of devices in essentialcraft not only use MRU, but also convert it to more 'elemental' state. And if the simplest devices can do this using the basic Elemental Cores, more advanced devices may require a more specific item.
essentialcraft.page.crystals_1.txt=You have found an answer in your knowledge of earlier times. Back in time, in places with huge MRU concentration there were those called 'crystals'. They used to be a main source of MRU energy, and worked kinda like a magnet for all MRU in the world.
essentialcraft.page.crystals_2.txt=Those crystals seem to serve exact the purpose you need! Even more - if you scrap them, they will drop some dust - essence, exactly the thing you need! 
essentialcraft.page.crystals_3.txt=However, there is a small problem. Lots of time has passed, and the crystals... no longer exsist. All destroyed, blown up or just disappeared because of MRU changes in the world. The idea - busted? Of course no!
essentialcraft.page.crystals_4.txt=After lots of work you were able to recreate a crystal! Somewhat, at least. The crystal you've made broke almost instantly. But it was that exact crystal!
essentialcraft.page.crystals_5.txt=After a little bit more work you've discovered a way to create a machine, that can create the smallest, yet pretty resistant crystal from diamonds, water, glass and LOTS of MRU!
essentialcraft.page.crystals_7.txt=The bottom 3 slots are for buckets with water, 2 slots in the middle are for glass and the top slot is for diamond. Just supply the machine with MRU and wait. The crystal will appear in the top-left slot.
essentialcraft.page.crystals_8.txt=By default the crystal is too small for your eyes to actually see it. To make it grow - just place the crystal on the ground anywhere. It will start growing.
essentialcraft.page.crystals_9.txt=It takes nearly 30 minutes of real time to grow 1 crystal to 100%. But here lies the problem. Those elder crystals were created instantly, just because of MRU leaks. You are unable to replicate the MRU beam created them, so your crystals differ.
essentialcraft.page.crystals_10.txt=First of all, your crystals CAN actually be broken even with an empty hand. They will drop, and you can place them anywhere you want. Second of all, because of all that growing process your crystals are not so much affected by elements.
essentialcraft.page.crystals_11.txt=You have discovered a way to control the growth of those crystals! The devise, if supplied with MRU will give you a complete information about the crystal it is placed next to. There is more - if you place some essence in the bottom slot it will increase the crystal's affection by that element.
essentialcraft.page.crystals_13.txt=If your crystal had grown you can start extracting essences. This exact device can do so - just place it next to the fully grown crystal and supply it with MRU.
essentialcraft.page.crystals_15.txt=From those essences you can create some Elemental Fuel, and it can be used to create a thing you need - Elemental Foci!
essentialcraft.page.matrixSwitch_0.txt=As you know matrix is no more than just a form of MRU Field controlled by a living mind. But does this mean, that the laws of MRU Field also work for the matrix? You were able to create an item, that can change the BALANCE of anyone's matrix.
essentialcraft.page.matrixSwitch_1.txt=Just take this in your hand and hold right mouse button. Do not be afraid - yes, it will be painful, but as a result your matrix will turn different! There is not a lot of a practical use for this, however it can already be used in some circumstances.
essentialcraft.page.enderGen_0.txt=Those endermen kept stealing your blocks, so you've came up with a way to teach them! This device will teleport nearby endermen to itself and damage them until they are dead! It will generate 500MRU per hit, so 1 enderman gives you around 20000MRU!
essentialcraft.page.coldDistillator_0.txt=As we all know - the less the temperature, the slower the movement of molecules and atoms in a thing. Maybe, if you slow their movement enough you will be able to remove MRU particles from the air itself?
essentialcraft.page.coldDistillator_1.txt=The Cold Distillator is a device, that absorbs the cold from blocks in a 3 block radius around it to generate some cold, cool down the air and, therefore, remove MRU particles from it and give them to you!
essentialcraft.page.coldDistillator_2.txt=This device is rather dangerous, the cold air around it can kill living beings, so be careful!|As was already said, this device absorbs cold from blocks, and different blocks give you different cold levels!
essentialcraft.page.coldDistillator_3.txt=+0.05 MRU/tick.
essentialcraft.page.coldDistillator_4.txt=+0.2 MRU/tick.
essentialcraft.page.coldDistillator_5.txt=+0.15 MRU/tick.
essentialcraft.page.coldDistillator_6.txt=+0.3 MRU/tick.
essentialcraft.page.coldDistillator_7.txt=+0.5 MRU/tick.
essentialcraft.page.solarAbsorber_0.txt=There is one more thing to talk about. Those photons! The light-particles. Maybe they can be somehow used to interact with MRU? And yes, indeed they can! By applying some solar rays to that MRU metal through a magnifying glass for all day you got some MRU! 10, maybe...
essentialcraft.page.solarAbsorber_1.txt=Of course that is a really small amount. Maybe you can come up with a better way to do so? And you have! The answer is really simple - a HUGE magnifying glass! Well, not a simple magnifying glass, but MRU infused one!
essentialcraft.page.solarAbsorber_2.txt=This can be dangerous, but who cares, right? Just placing the glass under an open sky during nice midday, no rain, no clouds, will create a beam of destructing solar energy, able to melt through metals! Now you just need a way to harness that power.
essentialcraft.page.solarAbsorber_5.txt=And this is where the Sun Ray Absorber you've constructed comes into play. This device can absorb those rays of energy generating a shocking 500! MRU/TICK! That are lots, lots of MRU particles!
essentialcraft.page.moonWell_0.txt=So, we've messed with the sun, cold, darkness and such. What is left? The moon is the answer! It shines up in the sky, and it may help you with getting MRU. The device you were able to construct absorbs moonlight and extracts MRU out of it.
essentialcraft.page.moonWell_1.txt=Obviously the photons have no MRU particles, but the moonlight traveling through the air occasionally collects some. The further it travels -> the more MRU. So, place this device as low as possible!
essentialcraft.page.moonWell_2.txt=The rate at which moonlight collects MRU seems to be bound to the current phase of the moon, so the device is most efficient during full moon and generates no MRU if there is no moon.
essentialcraft.page.reactor_0.txt=MRU and electricity, electricity and MRU... There are lots of things to be said about the way those things interact, but for now you need to know one fact - you can create an infinite source of MRU using those two! Or somewhat similar...
essentialcraft.page.reactor_2.txt=MRU reactor is a tough thing to build, so the structure shape for this will come in 3 layers, on next 3 pages.
essentialcraft.page.reactor_8.txt=The reactor is pretty dangerous, so be sure to place it as far away as you can. Also, it generates completely unbalanced MRU energy, so make sure to back off!
essentialcraft.page.soulStorage_0.txt=You can store MRU in different items too, not only in a structure! Those items serve the purpose of a battery, so if any item in your inventory requires MRU it will try to take it from the storage first.
essentialcraft.page.soulStorage_1.txt=Soul shard. Stores 500 MRU.
essentialcraft.page.soulStorage_2.txt=Soul Sphere. Stores 5,000 MRU.
essentialcraft.page.soulStorage_3.txt=Dark Soul Matter. Stores 30,000 MRU.
essentialcraft.page.soulStorage_4.txt=Red Soul Matter. Stores 120,000 MRU.
essentialcraft.page.soulStorage_5.txt=Matter of Eternity. Stores 1,000,000 MRU.
essentialcraft.page.soulStorage_6.txt=This device is able to charge this items. Just put them in the Bottom right slot of the device, and supply it with MRU.
essentialcraft.page.magicalDigger_0.txt=This item serves as an alternative to, pretty much, any tool. It can break anything, and it is pretty efficient at it. It uses 9 MRU per block broken! If supplied with MRU and the holder is not sneaking upon breaking a block it will break all same blocks around the broken one. The device can also be used even without any MRU present, but it will be very slow.
essentialcraft.page.magicalLantern_0.txt=This item will light the terrain around you while you hold it in your hand. It can also put magical torches on the ground! Just right-click any block with it, and, if the lantern has some MRU and you have a magical slag in your inventory the light will appear!
essentialcraft.page.magnetizingStaff_0.txt=This item is able to attract items towards you if you hold the right mouse button with it in your hand. It consumes a tiny amount of MRU for doing so. An interesting effect - it also attracts experience orbs!
essentialcraft.page.spawnerCollector_0.txt=This item allows you to collect spawners. Just right-click any spawner with this item - and you have it! However. it takes 5000MRU to grab one spawner!
essentialcraft.page.lifeStaff_0.txt=This item serves as an AOE bonemeal - right-click any crop with it, and not only the crop you've clicked on will grow, but also all crops in 6 block radius around it! It can also instantly grow animals from their baby form to an adult upon left-clicking them.
essentialcraft.page.holyMace_0.txt=This item is a weapon, that has a Smite6 enchantment on it every second, so it is crazy good against undead. However, it is not so good against anything else, and uses MRU upon attacking.
essentialcraft.page.emeraldHeart_0.txt=This item restores half of your life upon eating. You are not actually eating it, so it will only consume some MRU.
essentialcraft.page.magicalWings_0.txt=This item pushes you up in the air while you hold it. As you remove it from your hand you will start descending. Holding shift while it is in your inventory will negate all fall damage and make you slide instead of falling!
essentialcraft.page.magicalPorkchop_0.txt=At some cost of MRU restores some hunger. Pretty self-explanatory.
essentialcraft.page.magicalWater_0.txt=This item, at a cost of some MRU will remove ALL status effects from you if you drink it. Can remove Thaumcraft warp effects as well. Unable to remove radiation, however.
essentialcraft.page.magicalShield_0.txt=Upon blocking with this item the player will be granted invincibility to all incoming damage at a huge cost of MRU. The upgraded version also damages all enemies of a player in a range of 5 blocks when the block wears off.
essentialcraft.page.biomeWand_0.txt=We all know, that in Minecraft biomes are permanent and unchangeable. No longer the case! This item can store any kind of biome in it upon right-clicking the ground. After that, you can right-click the ground anywhere else, and the biome at that position will be changed to the stored one! You can reset the biome the wand holds if right-clicking while sneaking.
essentialcraft.page.chaosFork_0.txt=This weapon only functions if your MRU Matrix is set to Chaos. Upon the first strike this weapon will deal 6 damage. Upon every next hit 2 unblockable damage will get added. Stacks infinitely.
essentialcraft.page.frozenMace_0.txt=This weapon only functions if your MRU Matrix is set to Frost. Upon the first strike nothing special will happen. Upon any next strikes the attacked entity will have his movement and attack speed slowed by 18%. Stacks infinitely.
essentialcraft.page.magmaticStaff_0.txt=This item, much alike the Magmatic Smeltery upon right-clicking any ore will smelt it into the corresponding Magmatic Alloy.
essentialcraft.page.mhs_0.txt=This set of armor grants the wearer a great protection from any type of MRU damage, such as - passive radiation from working devices, active MRU radiation and MRU corruption blocks in the world. The armor is better than diamond and has a great enchantability.
essentialcraft.page.elementalCharms_0.txt=This items are infused with elements. It allows them to interact with the wearer at a cost of some MRU under special occasions. In order to function the charm must be located anywhere in the inventory.
essentialcraft.page.elementalCharms_1.txt=Fire charm: grants the wearer immunity to burning, however not to fire and lava damage.
essentialcraft.page.elementalCharms_2.txt=Water charm: grants the wearer infinite breath under water.
essentialcraft.page.elementalCharms_3.txt=Earth charm: become immune to damage after being hit for a couple seconds.
essentialcraft.page.elementalCharms_4.txt=Air charm: acquire a speed boost upon sprinting.
essentialcraft.page.elementalCharms_5.txt=Steam charm: get a huge speed boost when almost dead.
essentialcraft.page.elementalCharms_6.txt=Magma charm: grands the wearer immunity to lava. Somewhat.
essentialcraft.page.elementalCharms_7.txt=Lightning charm: acquire great buffs when it's thundering.
essentialcraft.page.elementalCharms_8.txt=Life charm: grants the wearer some health regeneration. Functions better at low health.
essentialcraft.page.elementalCharms_9.txt=Rain charm: acquire buffs while it's raining.
essentialcraft.page.elementalCharms_10.txt=Dust charm: acquire great buffs when standing on sand or gravel.
essentialcraft.page.mruCoil_0.txt=This structure is capable of destroying everything that is a living entity in... unlimited radius. As long as you have the resources and the MRU.
essentialcraft.page.mruCoil_4.txt=Place the coil block in the middle. It can also be placed on top of those Coil hardeners to increase the range of the coil. MRU Coil Hardeners can be stacked as much as you want. Every hardener increases the range of the coil by 1.
essentialcraft.page.mruCoil_5.txt=Before supplying this beast with MRU make sure to place a Player Whitelist inside it. The Player Whitelist specifies the players, which will not get attached by the coil, and can also open it's GUI. To add a player to the list make him right-click with the list in their hand. Make sure to add yourself to the list!
essentialcraft.page.mruCoil_7.txt=The coil damages a random mob in it's radius every second for 18! damage. It uses 2000 MRU per hit.
essentialcraft.page.potionSpreader_0.txt=This device is able to spread any potion, that was put inside it, to an area of 16 blocks around it. The spreading happens when required, therefore your potion can last for a really long time. Usually 1 potion is enough for 8 bursts!
essentialcraft.page.magicalEnchanter_0.txt=This device can enchant any enchantable items up to level 60! If supplied with enough MRU and bookshelves. 1 bookshelf = 1 level.
essentialcraft.page.monsterHolder_0.txt=This device is able to stop any entity, except for the players, from wandering away from itself more than 12 blocks. It uses 1 MRU per entity. Can keep even something like the Wither.
essentialcraft.page.magicalJukebox_0.txt=This device is able to play any music disc inside it, if supplied with a redstone signal and some MRU. Find a use for this yourself!
essentialcraft.page.magicalRepairer_0.txt=This nifty device is capable of repairing almost any item, that can be damaged! It uses some MRU to do so, however.
essentialcraft.page.monsterDuplicator_0.txt=Not exactly as it sounds, this device is capable of creating any DROPS from MOBS nearby, not harming the actual mobs. In it's central slot you can put anything, and the drop will be created the same way, as if you have killed the mob with this item in your hand(hint: looting is the one).
essentialcraft.page.magmaticSmeltery_0.txt=This device is a complicated one. It is a way to QUADRIPLE your ores. On the next page there is a GUI with all necessary slots marked with numbers. I will tell you about those slots, because that is the easiest explanation I can come up with for this thing.
essentialcraft.page.magmaticSmeltery_2.txt=Slot 1. This slot is used for any LAVA container item. Buckets of lava, tin cans, tanks, etc.|Slot 2. This slot is for the CONTAINER itself. Let's say, you've put a lava bucket in the slot 1. Then, the EMPTY bucket will appear in the slot 2.
essentialcraft.page.magmaticSmeltery_3.txt=Slot 3. Here you can put your ore, and, if you have enough MRU and Lava in this device the smelting process will begin. It is kinda slow, but it is worth it.|Slot 4. Here the so called 'Magmatic Alloys' will appear. The Magmatic Alloy is what you get after smelting any ore.
essentialcraft.page.magmaticSmeltery_4.txt=Slot 5. Here you can put your Magmatic Alloys and they will be smelted into the regular ore smelting result.|Slot 6. Here is the slot for the smelting result to appear.
essentialcraft.page.magmaticSmeltery_5.txt=Slot 7. Upon smelting ores and Magmatic Alloys you have a chance of Magical Slags to appear in this slot.
essentialcraft.page.magmaticSmeltery_6.txt=The list of ores for this device includes: Default MC's ores, IC2's Ores, Thaumcraft's Infused Stone and TConstruct's one too!
essentialcraft.page.magicalQuarry_0.txt=This device is able to... well, dig the blocks out for you! The way it functions is pretty simple - You place this block down, give it some MRU, put AT LEAST 1 Efficiency Upgrade in it and it will start mining! It mines out everything, including liquids, so do not worry about water and lava.
essentialcraft.page.magicalQuarry_1.txt=First it will attempt to mine a straight column directly underneath itself. It is worth pointing out, that the device will not touch 3 blocks under itself in any direction, but the mining will start at the 4th block.
essentialcraft.page.magicalQuarry_2.txt=When the device is finished mining out the column underneath it, it will start to mine blocks in all it's radius, layer by layer. So, it functions very similar to BC quarry.
essentialcraft.page.magicalQuarry_3.txt=The device has 3 slots for upgrades(and those stack with each other, so you can put up to a stack in each slot). Usually, the more upgrades you have in it, the more effective they are going to be.
essentialcraft.page.magicalQuarry_4.txt=Efficiency upgrade. Increases the mining speed of a quarry by 0.5. Wooden pick mines with a speed of 2.0, and the gold one is 12.0
essentialcraft.page.magicalQuarry_5.txt=Range upgrade. Each one increases the mining range by 1.
essentialcraft.page.magicalQuarry_6.txt=Inventory upgrade makes it so the quarry will not throw items out of it's top, but instead will put them inside the inventory located ABOVE.
essentialcraft.page.magicalQuarry_7.txt=Silk Touch upgrade is a Mining Type modifier. It takes priority over the Smelting Upgrade. A quarry with this upgrade will mine blocks just as it had a Silk Touch enchanted pickaxe.
essentialcraft.page.magicalQuarry_8.txt=Void upgrade will make the quarry delete blocks like stone, dirt, sand, etc. instead of mining them. Will not work with blocks added by mods!
essentialcraft.page.magicalQuarry_9.txt=Fortune upgrade is a Mining Type modifier. It is the weakest of the modifiers - all others take priority over it. A quarry with this upgrade will mine blocks just as it had a Fortune enchanted pickaxe.
essentialcraft.page.magicalQuarry_10.txt=Smelting upgrade is a Mining Type modifier. It takes priority over the Fortune upgrade. A quarry with this upgrade will attempt to smelt whatever it is mining. Decreases mining speed!
essentialcraft.page.hoanna_0.txt=There is an ancient legend... A legend about a world, that was the FIRST one in the path of the destructive force we know as MRU. The legend carries very limited information about the world, but you've managed to get some USEFULL.
essentialcraft.page.hoanna_1.txt="Thus world is a place of technology and magic mixed, combined and fully functional. It c.......|...The man called the Wind, and the Wind itself came to the man, and brought him to the land of dreams, to Hoanna, the world of limitless possibilities"
essentialcraft.page.hoanna_2.txt=The legend clearly says, that the world itself is a beautiful place, and that man visited it in the past with the help of a wind. And, guess what? You KNOW that exact wind, and you've interacted with it couple of times already.
essentialcraft.page.hoanna_3.txt=The legend mentions, that the man called the wind by it's name. You do not know the name of the wind, but maybe MRU can help you with it?
essentialcraft.page.hoanna_4.txt=This tablet serves the only purpose - to translate the blows of wind into normal human language.
essentialcraft.page.hoanna_5.txt=The description should have some question marks or just letters. You need to make sure, that there are no question marks, and therefore - that you know the full name of the wind!
essentialcraft.page.hoanna_6.txt=The process of visiting Hoanna should not be hard. First of all, have a supply of MRU in your inventory - the tablet may require lots of MRU energy to encode the wind's messages.
essentialcraft.page.hoanna_7.txt=If you know the full name of the wind - you can proceed further.
essentialcraft.page.hoanna_8.txt=A basic form or shape for a portal shall be done - build a nether portal, and - LIGHT IT UP. Yep, create a regular nether portal. Do not step inside it yet.
essentialcraft.page.hoanna_9.txt=Step into the portal and activate the tablet one time. The portal blocks will transform into Hoanna Portal Blocks. The Hoanna waits! You are sure, that the materials from that world will help the book to get new information...

essentialcraft.page.radiation_0.txt=Not looking so hot, eh? It was all a lie, after all. The "world of great opportunities", the "place of technology and magic mixed, combined and fully functional", the "land of dreams"... Is a NUCLEAR DESERT. What happened? Who knows, but this place is, for sure, a dangerous one!
essentialcraft.page.radiation_1.txt=Scorching sun, empty destroyed cities and underground catacombs - this place is a terrible one. The air itself is poisoned, and if you breath it for too long - you will die. 
essentialcraft.page.radiation_2.txt=Different areas seem more poisoned, than the others, sometimes you can find an area to rest, with it's air almost clear. And some areas make your lungs set on fire from a single breath of air.
essentialcraft.page.radiation_3.txt=There is no cure for radiation, and no way of removing it. If you got affected by it - time is your only panacea. No magical "milk drinking", no "amulets".
essentialcraft.page.radiation_4.txt=However, some special constructed armor may help you with fighting that radiation. For example, the Magical Hazmat Suit one. Just be sure to wear a full set - otherwise it is as useless as an Iron armor in this world.
essentialcraft.page.radiation_5.txt=Sometimes the loot in this world contains some baubles - the seem to help with fighting radiation too!
essentialcraft.page.radiation_6.txt=This world is a dreadful place - sometimes those "events" occurs. Like, it is suddenly so dark, that you can barely see your hand! Or the opposite - it is so bright, that everything, including air is burning! And sometimes the poisonous gas comes from the cracks in the ground...
essentialcraft.page.radiation_7.txt=Overall - this place is really dangerous, yet it may yield lots of interesting loot!
essentialcraft.page.loot_0.txt=The Hoanna contains remains of past civilizations - they left some loot! Rarely, in towns or underground you can find chests with different items in them!
essentialcraft.page.voidStone_0.txt=Different materials you've found in Hoanna allow to create much more advanced blocks, which can almost fully negate MRU flowing through them. You sure can use them for some things!
essentialcraft.page.voidArmor_0.txt=This set of armor proves to be the best in the game. It makes you almost immune to radiation and MRU effects, it increases your max health by 20, it gives you various buffs, it is nearly unbreakable, better than diamond and has the best enchantability!
essentialcraft.page.magicalTeleporter_0.txt=This structure is able to teleport the player ANY DISTANCE !INCLUDING! different DIMENSIONS! Just place this structure anywhere, use the bound gem to set a location to teleport to, supply this device with MRU and place the bound gem in the second slot. Now step in the middle, and see, what happens!
essentialcraft.page.magicalTeleporter_2.txt=Row 0. A 5x5 layer of Void Stone with a teleporter in the middle
essentialcraft.page.magicalTeleporter_3.txt=Row 1. Row 1 means that it is higher than row 0 by 1 on Y axis.
essentialcraft.page.magicalTeleporter_4.txt=Row 2. Row 2 means that it is higher than row 0 by 2 on Y axis.
essentialcraft.page.magicalFurnace_0.txt=This structure is able to smelt items thrown on top of it just like the regular furnace would. But it takes around 0.8 second to smelt an item, has a 30% chance of doubling the outcome and produces Magical Slags.
essentialcraft.page.magicalFurnace_2.txt=Row 0. A 5x5 layer of Void Stone.
essentialcraft.page.magicalFurnace_3.txt=Row 1. Row 1 means that it is higher than row 0 by 1 on Y axis.
essentialcraft.page.magicalFurnace_4.txt=Row 2. Row 2 means that it is higher than row 0 by 2 on Y axis.
essentialcraft.page.emberForge_0.txt=This structure allows the production of so called "Elemental Swords". Basically, throw some Elemental Foci at the Magic Plating Blocks, and then throw some Embers you found in the dungeons on the Pale Plating blocks, wait for it to be night time... and wait a little bit.
essentialcraft.page.emberForge_2.txt=Row 0. A 5x5 layer of Void Stone.
essentialcraft.page.emberForge_3.txt=Row 1. Row 1 means that it is higher than row 0 by 1 on Y axis.
essentialcraft.page.emberForge_4.txt=Row 2. Row 2 means that it is higher than row 0 by 2 on Y axis.
essentialcraft.page.mim_0.txt=You can create a system, that will allow you to manage the inventories all among your base. This system consists of some devices, each serves it's functionalities.
essentialcraft.page.mim_2.txt=Filter. This filter can be opened by right-clicking it in your hand. In the GUI you have 9 slots. In each you can put any item, and it will be filtered by other devices in the system. Putting a filter in a filter will allow you to specify more items.
essentialcraft.page.mim_4.txt=Advanced Filter. This filter functions the same way as the previous one does, except, that you can specify, if you want to ignore Metadata, NBTData, or you can check items by Ore Dictionary, and not their IDs.
essentialcraft.page.mim_7.txt=Ejection Nodes - you can use this to eject items out of inventories. If you use the basic one you need to attach this to the side you want to extract the items from. Putting a filter in the top slot will make the ejector to eject only items, which are stated in the filter.
essentialcraft.page.mim_8.txt=Advanced Ejection Node allows you to specify the slot to pull items from. The side you are attaching this device to does not matter. It is also possible to eject items from slots, from which items can't normally be ejected.
essentialcraft.page.mim_11.txt=Injection Nodes - work the same way as the ejection ones, but they Insert items into slots, instead of ejecting them.
essentialcraft.page.mim_13.txt=The manager itself is a core of the system. You need to supply it with MRU, and then, you need to link every device in your systems(nodes) with bound gems. After that put your bound gems in this device in the order, you want them to be accessed.
essentialcraft.page.o8elisk_0.txt=This device forces monsters to spawn near8y. It will spawn 8iome-specific monsters too! If you place a spawner in it's 8ottom slot, it will instead function just like that spawner! It does not requires players to 8e near8y to function, which is gr8 for your spawning systems! 
essentialcraft.page.ultraHeat_0.txt=This is a straight upgrade over the Heat Generator. It functions just the same way, except for the fact, that it requires time to heat up, and the more it is heated up, the more MRU it produces. There is no heat limit too! The more it's heated, the less fuel it will consume.
essentialcraft.page.ultraFlower_0.txt=This is a straight upgrade over the Natural Furnace. This device functions the same way as the regular Natural Furnace does, except for the fact, that it creates much more MRU, does not burn saplings, but burns leaves and logs, and automatically replants all the saplings dropped by burned leaves!

essentialcraft.page.magicalActivator_0.txt=This device is able to act like a player - if given a redstone signal it will use the item or block that is placed in it's central slot. It is also able to look like any block placed in it's top right slot. In fact, it looks so natural, that it is able to fool some block tellers like WAILA too!
essentialcraft.page.magicalActivator_1.txt=It also has a slot for the bound gem and an MRU storage.MRU is not required for this device to work! However, shall you put any MRU requiring item in it's central slot and upon usage of that item MRU will get used from this device's buffer!
essentialcraft.page.magicalActivator_2.txt=Shall one craft any type of activator with a slimeball, and the activator will turn into a sneaky one, saving all properties of the one it was crafted from! It also starts using items just like the player would with holding a sneak key.
essentialcraft.page.magicalActivator_3.txt=If this device is crafted with a chest it gains 8 additional slots. Upon a redstone signal it will now use all the items from all it's 9 slots, one by one. However, it is not smart enough to know the existence of other items upon using one.
essentialcraft.page.magicalActivator_4.txt=Giving the device with the chest a piece of redstone makes it smarter, therefore it will now work just like it shoud - with actually taking all 9 slots into account when using one.

essentialcraft.page.redstoneTransmitter_0.txt=This device, once supplied with a bound gem will detect a redstone signal on the Redstone Transmitter it is linked to via the bound gem and output the same redstone signal as the one it is linked to is recieving.
essentialcraft.page.redstoneTransmitter_1.txt=It can transfer the redstone pretty much any distance, as long as the chunks are loaded. However, it comes with some disadvantages - it takes some time for the redstone pulse to travel. It is also unable to transfer redstone between dimensions.
essentialcraft.page.redstoneTransmitter_2.txt=You also need to give the redstone signal not directly to this device, but instead to the block it is placed on.

essentialcraft.page.magicalHopper_0.txt=This wonderful device will pick up items in the range of 3 blocks around itself, and will throw them in front of itself. It is also possible to disable it via a redstone signal. It will also not pick up items thrown in front of it. It can also be told which items to collect by placing a filter inside it's inventory.

essentialcraft.page.metadataManager_0.txt=This block will output a redstone signal with the strength equal to the metadata of the block it is placed next to. However, it will not cause a block update itself, so for the things like wheat you will need to give this device a block update to handle the wheat change.

essentialcraft.page.blockBreaker_0.txt=This device upon receiving a redstone signal will break up to 12 blocks in front of itself, which have the same HARDNESS(the amount of time required to break the block). It will also try to collect drops from the broken blocks and split them out of the back of itself.

essentialcraft.page.weaponMaker_0.txt=You already know that MRU is a dangerous thing. But MRU is radiation, right? You think, that you might be able to create a weapon, that will create concentrated MRU rays, which should kill everything that exists.
essentialcraft.page.weaponMaker_1.txt=The weapon bench is able to create guns for you. Opening it up brings an interesting GUI. There are 4 types of weapons, which you can made, and to switch between the crafting patterns just put the bench in the crafting window.
essentialcraft.page.weaponMaker_2.txt=The Pistol, which is the most basic gun. It requires a Base, a Handle and a Mechanism to be created. The pistol cools down much faster, than any other gun.
essentialcraft.page.weaponMaker_3.txt=The Rifle shoots much faster than the pistol. It also is able to shoot more rays before overheating. However, the shots have much less accuracy. It requires a Base, a Handle and a Mechanism to be created.
essentialcraft.page.weaponMaker_4.txt=The Sniper Rifle is a very slow weapon. It, however, deals massive damage. It requires a Base, a Handle, a Mechanism and a Scope to be created. It's scopes can also provide up to 16x zoom on things.
essentialcraft.page.weaponMaker_5.txt=The Gatling. This gun slows you down if you are holding it. It also takes 3 seconds of preparation before you are able to shoot. However, it has INSANE shot speed, and can shoot insane amounts of shots before overheating. It requires a Base, a Handle, a Mechanism and a Lens to be created.
essentialcraft.page.weaponMaker_6.txt=Each slot has a letter next to it. B means that the material in this slot will be used as a Base for the gun. H means Handle, M means Mechanism and S means Scope for the Sniper. Slots with the same letters require the same material to be in all of them. However, other slots may have different materials. Each material has it's unique properties.
essentialcraft.page.weaponMaker_7.txt=Some guns are different - the Sniper not only requires Glass alloy as a scope, it also requires one of the possible materials to make one. Gatling requires a Sun Imbued Glass as a part of it's lens.
essentialcraft.page.weaponMaker_8.txt=Lens is only required for the Gatling, other guns may work without it. Lenses only affect the color of the ray (SHADE lens works as a SHADE damage type)
essentialcraft.page.weaponMaker_9.txt=Scope is only required for the Sniper. Other guns may work without it. To zoom in hold Shift while holding the gun with a scope.
essentialcraft.page.weaponMaker_10.txt=Guns have a lot of different parameters, which can be viewed by pressing shift while mousing over a gun.
essentialcraft.page.weaponMaker_11.txt=Guns will occasionally break. They will never get destroyed though. If the gun is broken upon each shot it will have a chance to instantly overheat. Guns can be repaired in the anvil using the same material that was used to create the base of the gun.
essentialcraft.page.weaponMaker_12.txt=Guns also require MRU to shoot - the more damage the gun deals the more MRU it requires.
essentialcraft.page.weaponMaker_13.txt=The MRU ray the guns shoot passes through non-solid blocks. It, however, may get stopped by any solid block. It also passes through entities, dealing damage to each it passes through. It looses no damage upon passing through entity. MRU rays are visible for 3 seconds after the shot has been done.
essentialcraft.page.weaponMaker_14.txt=The last note is about PVP. The guns are extremely efficient at killing other players. However, it is worth noticing, that MRU rays have a devastating effect on the Matrix of the player it passed through, up to the point of complete matrix destruction.

essentialcraft.page.magmaticFurnace_0.txt=Magmatic Furnaces are your most basic way of doubling your ores! The furnaces use MRU to smelt ores into Magmatic Alloys, and can then smelt those alloys into corresponding ingots!

essentialcraft.page.magicalBuilder_0.txt=This wand has nearly unlimited powers... But remember - with great power comes great responsibility...
essentialcraft.page.magicalBuilder_1.txt=Right-click any block to store it's position into a wand. Selecting 2 blocks will form a region between them. This region is the one you will operate with. To reset wand's positions - sneak - right-click the air.
essentialcraft.page.magicalBuilder_2.txt=Shift-clicking any block will remember the block into the wand. It is worth saying, that the wand can't memorize some blocks like reeds, beds, doors, etc. Inventories are stored, but without remembering their content.
essentialcraft.page.magicalBuilder_3.txt=To perform any operation just right-click the air. Each operation will cost something: setting blocks costs 25 MRU/block, and also will consume the block from your inventory. Setting blocks to air costs 250 MRU/block!
essentialcraft.page.magicalBuilder_4.txt=To switch between modes just put the wand into a crafting window. Blocks broken by the wand will get dropped. Things like chests will also drop the corresponding content.
essentialcraft.page.magicalBuilder_5.txt=The wand can select a region with a maximum length between 2 locations of 48 blocks. Wand can't operate with blocks like bedrock.

essentialcraft.page.enderstar_0.txt=The Enderstar. What is it? The Enderstar, or sometimes referenced as 'The Green Sun' is a mysterious object, that exists on the other material plane. It actually is so far from yours, that there is no way to see or feel the enderstar...
essentialcraft.page.enderstar_1.txt=Not much is known about this mysterious object, but some ancient knowledge exists. It teaches, that the Enderstar is the thing, that gives life to everything and everyone via Pulses - chaotic, uncontrollable pulses of destructive energy, which, upon appearing into our plane gets too weakened to damage anything.
essentialcraft.page.enderstar_2.txt=This energy is called ESPE - Ender Star Pulse Energy, and it seems possible to collect it... But who knows how?..

essentialcraft.page.mithriline_0.txt=The Enderstar Pulses do not change anything on their own... However, it seems, that some MRU rays were caught by the pulse when they were passing through your world. That changed something - however, not much. It seems, that most of the world stayed unaffected, but what was already so.
essentialcraft.page.mithriline_1.txt=Some Elemental Infused Ore is now replaced with Mithriline Ore. The amount of Mithriline dropped is affected by the fortune enchantment.
essentialcraft.page.mithriline_2.txt=Mithriline Plating can be used as a part of MRUCU Enrichment Chamber, giving it a lot of protection against MRU rays.
essentialcraft.page.mithriline_3.txt=Mithriline Crystals seem to be able to collect a tiny piece of ESPE each tick. That can be used later. They also can be improved by adding more materials to them, though it seems to have no effect on the amount of ESPE collected. The Crystals also will work 4 times better in the end.

essentialcraft.page.mithrilineFurnace_0.txt=This structure is able to harness the power of the Enderstar to transform some items into other. The most important thing that it can do - it can transform Glowstone into Mithriline Dust! It can also transform 1 piece of mithriline dust into 1 mithriline ingot. Also, MRU Resonating Crystals can be transfromed into Mithriline Crystals.
essentialcraft.page.mithrilineFurnace_1.txt=The Mithriline Crystal can be transformed into Fading Crystal, which gets transformed into Fading Dust. It is also worth trying transforming other items, like redstone or ender pearls - this may yield some interesting results! It is also worth noticing that the furnace can get ESPE from not only 4 corner crystals, but from crystals, placed on top of Mithriline Plating Blocks.

essentialcraft.page.windRune_0.txt=If you want the ancient wind to help you out on your journey - this is the way to do so! This rune, once placed correctly will use the ESPE from the crystals to infuse items with wind. To infuse the item just right-click the rune with the item you want to infuse.
essentialcraft.page.windRune_1.txt=Infusing a Soul Stone will imbue the player with a strength of the wind, therefore they may start gathering wind relation points to visit Hoanna. 
essentialcraft.page.windRune_2.txt=One can also infuse diamonds with wind, making Wind Gems. Wind gems can be used to make tools and armor.
essentialcraft.page.windRune_3.txt=Wind tools are a multitool - should the player start mining the wrong block - the tool in his hand will transform into the correct one. The wind tools will also store their enchantments upon transformation.
essentialcraft.page.windRune_4.txt=Wind armor gains some benefits. The helmet allows seeing MRU and MRUCUs. Wind chestplate greatly increases the wearer's movement speed. Wind Leggings allow the wearer to jump 1.5 blocks higher than normal, and wind boots provide step assistance.

essentialcraft.page.playerPentacle_0.txt=MRU rays spat out by both MRUCUs and MRU guns will deal some matrix damage to the player, who gets caught in them. Using the Enderstar energy you've managed to create a device, that is able to remove those effects. Weirdly enough the structure has multiple tiers.
essentialcraft.page.playerPentacle_1.txt=Tier 1. This tier is the most basic - it is able to remove the most basic "Body Damage" from you using the energy of the Mithriline Crystals.
essentialcraft.page.playerPentacle_2.txt=Tier 2. This tier is able to purge Mind damage, as well as the body damage.
essentialcraft.page.playerPentacle_3.txt=Tier 3. This one is able to remove most of the Matrix Damage, as well as Mind damage and Body Damage
essentialcraft.page.playerPentacle_4.txt=Tier 4. This one is the most powerful, which is not only able to completely restore the matrix, it is also capable of accumulating twice as much ESPE twice fast.

essentialcraft.page.demonicPentacle_0.txt=You seem stuck - your Mithriline Crystals are too mundane for some things. All books seem to give you no information... Except for the "Forgotten Necronomicon". That book tells about Ackronite, the metal, that only exists in hell, and only Demons can see and mine it.
essentialcraft.page.demonicPentacle_1.txt=That material seems to have all the properties you need. So, you need to summon a demon and trade with him. Be aware though, demons only care about themselves, and they will try to fool you - do not give them any information related to your world, like maps and such - they will invade your world if you do so.
essentialcraft.page.demonicPentacle_2.txt=The demon will take everything you give him as a present, so you need to give him as much items of the type he desires at once. If you do not want his offer - punch him and he will disappear. They always give you some Ackronite as a trade, though you never know how much... 
essentialcraft.page.demonicPentacle_3.txt=This sacred weapon is able to capture the soul of a creature it kills. Souls can be traded to demons.

essentialcraft.page.hologram_0.txt=There are rumors about this place - some people tell, that the mysterious 'Inquisition' is somewhere here, in Hoaana. However, no matter how hard you try you can't find them. Also, you seem to be stuck on things to do - you may find a use for that Ackronite... But you are clearly missing something...
essentialcraft.page.hologram_1.txt=You need a way to control the Demonic Plates. Something to make it all work. The AI, the Computer! However, your technology is not advanced enough to make one... Maybe this mysterious inquisition can help you out?
essentialcraft.page.hologram_2.txt=You have managed to create a device, that should send a great signal throughout the Hoanna. If the Inquisition exists it will get notified, and may contact you... However, you MUST prepare as much, as possible - no one knows, what may happen once you run this device...
essentialcraft.page.hologram_3.txt=The block must be placed in the Hoanna under an open sky, and then activated with a simple tight-click. Note - once you activate the beacon - there is no way back...

essentialcraft.page.redSuit_0.txt=You may have found a way to create something... Powerful. Like, really - god level of power. You might be missing some components still, but that problem is solvable. You can create an extremely big contraption, that can be worn as an armor of some sort!
essentialcraft.page.redSuit_1.txt=You can predict, that the armor will block ALL incoming damage, no matter where it came from. It should also offer protection against things like poison. Also, it should give you some bonuses, which should go like that ->
essentialcraft.page.redSuit_2.txt=The helmet will have Night Vision, if you want to enable it just press the corresponding key(default - X). The helmet will also allow you to see both the Aura Nodes and the MRU. Last, but not least, the helmet also gives the wearer infinite breath under water and infinite saturation all the time.
essentialcraft.page.redSuit_3.txt=The chestplate is the most essential component of the suit. It will offer most of the protection. It should also make you really strong using a body support system, that will increase your health up to 60!
essentialcraft.page.redSuit_4.txt=The leggings will allow you to run super-fast using the integrated thrusters. It will also allow you to jump up to 3 blocks high!
essentialcraft.page.redSuit_5.txt=The boots will come with an auto-step, or a step assistant feature. They will also negate ALL fall damage.
essentialcraft.page.redSuit_6.txt=The latest thing is the board. The board, once equipped in the belt slot will allow you to fly! Not only will it allow flight, it will also give you incredible speed while you are flying! 
essentialcraft.page.redSuit_7.txt=It is also worth noticing, that the armor is crazy powerful, but it comes with some negatives. It is extremely hard to craft the full suit, and the armor will not work fully, unless you are wearing a full-set of it. The armor will also require EXTREME amounts of MRU to sustain.
essentialcraft.page.redSuit_?.txt=Are you still alive after all those crafts? Good. `Cause I wasn't.

essentialcraft.page.magicalChest_0.txt=If it is possible to make chests out of wood, why not use magical materials for it too? Two chests are available to be crafted, from MRU plating and Void Blocks. First one has the capacity of 54 slots, the second - 117.
essentialcraft.page.replanter_0.txt=This device, once supplied with redstone signal will try to plant all items and blocks nearby as they were crops on the blocks below them. Will work with things like seeds, reeds, cacti, etc. Will not place the block if the placement conditions are not met.
essentialcraft.page.itemShuffler_0.txt=This device works not as it's name suggests. It will randomly move items around in a range of 12 blocks once supplied with a redstone signal. The item will never be moved more than 1 block. Will not move items upwards and downwards.
essentialcraft.page.crafter_0.txt=This device will try to craft the items in it's crafting grid into the appropriate recipe. Alternatively, a crafting frame may be installed - then it will only craft what the frame suggests, and it's slots will only be available for the valid crafting pattern.
essentialcraft.page.crafter_1.txt=The frame may be inserted in the slot above the crafting arrow. The frame itself has an option to use Ore Dictionary, or ignore it. You may place the result of the crafting in the frame, and it will choose the recipe itself.
essentialcraft.page.breeder_0.txt=This device, once supplied with a redstone signal will attempt to feed all nearby animals with items laying on the ground. It will only feed animals with appropriate food. Since the feeding is instant it is possible to get 2 babies from 3 animals.
essentialcraft.page.shearingStation_0.txt=This device, once supplied with a redstone signal will shear all shearable mobs nearby.
essentialcraft.page.separator_0.txt=This devices, once supplied with both MRU and a redstone signal will attempt to teleport all child animals nearby to the top of it, if it is a child separator, or if it is an adult one will instead teleport all grown animals on top.
essentialcraft.page.separator_1.txt=This device requires 100MRU/animal teleported, and ignores animals above it. It will also teleport animals even if there is no space for them to be in.
essentialcraft.page.advBreaker_0.txt=This device functions just like the device it is based on, but instead of breaking blocks with the same hardness it will break blocks defined by the filter in it's only slot.
essentialcraft.page.advBreaker_1.txt=Filters can be different, but they all work pretty much the same - they define the rules for items you put in them. You can put a filter in a filter, and then the filter in a filter will also work just the same way it would if it wouldn't be in a filter(that is one complicated way to put it, is it?)
essentialcraft.page.advBreaker_2.txt=Whitelist filters only allow devices to function with items defined within them.
essentialcraft.page.advBreaker_3.txt=Blacklist filters, on the other hand, will allow devices to interact with all items, but the ones defined within the filter
essentialcraft.page.advBreaker_4.txt=Advanced filters work the same as their bases, but they can be configured to ignore metadata/NBT data/Ore Dictionary.
essentialcraft.page.newMim_0.txt=This one is a very complicated device. However, the way to start would be to craft the Magical Inventory Manager Core. This is a modular device, which opens up an extremely efficient storage system with auto-crafting and exporting/importing.
essentialcraft.page.newMim_1.txt=The Manager is the core of the system. It is the one, that holds it all together. It has a lot of slots inside. They are all slots for Bound Gems, telling the manager the locations of it's modules.
essentialcraft.page.newMim_2.txt=The slots under the chest picture are for the Storage modules. You can read more about them in the Storage Module Discovery.
essentialcraft.page.newMim_3.txt=The slots under the X picture are for the Screen modules. You can read more about them in the Screen Module Discovery.
essentialcraft.page.newMim_4.txt=The slots under the 3x3 pattern picture are for the Crafting modules. You can read more about them in the Crafting Module Discovery.
essentialcraft.page.newMim_5.txt=The slots under the faced downwards arrow are for the Importing Nodes. The manager will import the items from the inventories the nodes are connected to into the system, based on the node filters and side of the inventory the node is attached to.
essentialcraft.page.newMim_6.txt=The slots under the faced upwards arrow are for the Exporting Nodes. The manager will export the items from the system into inventories the nodes are connected to, based on the node filters and side of the inventory the node is attached to.
essentialcraft.page.newMim_7.txt=The regular node will try to export/import items from the side of the inventory it is attached to. For example, to grab the result from your furnaces you would need to attach an Import Node to the bottom of the furnace. You can use filters to specify, which items the node is allowed to import/export.
essentialcraft.page.newMim_8.txt=The Persistent nodes function the same way, except for the fact, that the Persistent Export node will only export one item into the inventory slot. The import will not grab the latest item left in the slot.
essentialcraft.page.newMimInv_0.txt=This module is able to hold up to 54 Inventory Gems. Inventory Gem is the same as the Bound one, but it contains the coordinates of any Inventory, rather than any MRU Device. The Manager then will use all inventories marked in this module for storing items in.
essentialcraft.page.newMimInv_1.txt=Basically, any time the item is imported into the system the manager will go through the list of all inventories linked by the Inventory Gem in this device and find the one to put the item in. The exporting will work the same way.
essentialcraft.page.newMimInv_2.txt=Any inventory can be linked - hoppers, chests, brewing stands, etc. Nothing will happen to the inventories - they will still be the same - you will be able to normally interact with them, take items out or put them in. Press right-click with the Inventory Gem in your hand to see the inventory it is linked to.
essentialcraft.page.newMimCraft_0.txt=This module for the Magical Inventory Manager can hold up to 54 Crafting Frames. It will then make the recipes from the frames available in the Screen Modules. It sadly does not support multi-step crafting. It will take the items to craft from the Inventories, bound in the Inventory Module.
essentialcraft.page.newMimScreen_0.txt=This module for the Magical Inventory Manager allows you to easily access all the linked inventories in one GUI. Just select the item you want to grab, set the size using the buttons below, or the text field next to them and press Request. Alternatively, perform a double-click, shiftclick or press Enter on your keyboard.
essentialcraft.page.newMimScreen_1.txt=There is also a search bar at the top of the GUI - just type something it and only items containing the typed text in their names will be shown. The search bar is not case-sensitive.
essentialcraft.page.newMimScreen_2.txt=Crafting works the same way as requesting. You can also import items into the system using the screen - just above the request button there is an input slot. All items in there will automatically be put in the system. Shift-clicking also works.

essentialcraft.page.crystalLamp_0.txt=Those crystals are very transparent and can let light through. On its own this discovery is not worth much, but you were able to surround a regular torch with the crystals, fortify the construction with some cobble, and you've got yourself an amazing lamp that, while purely decorative, is a pretty nice light source!
